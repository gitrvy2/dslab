Under the supervision of Prof. Yong-Kee Jun, DS-Lab has fostered specialists in dependability of concurrent embedded software such as airborne software that controls, manages, and applies avionics. DS-Lab has produced approximately fifty masters for teachers as well as engineers, and eleven doctorates for professors as well as researchers in (international) four-year universities, major industries, and research institutes.
